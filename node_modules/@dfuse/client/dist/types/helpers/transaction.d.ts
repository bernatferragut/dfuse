/**
 * This method flattens the nested action traces of a [[TransactionLifecycle]] into
 * a single flat list. The flat list indexes matches dfuse API action index
 * which is used within dfuse to identify particular action trace in
 * various situation (db ops, RAM ops, etc).
 *
 * The action index of a given action is obtained simply by doing a
 * deep-first traversal of the action traces structure incrementing
 * a counter at each step and binding the counter to the current traversed
 * action becoming the action's index.
 *
 * As an example of this method, assume the following transaction:
 *
 * ```
 * Transaction 123 {
 *   ExecutionTrace {
 *     ActionTraces: [
 *       ActionTrace(eosio.token/eosio.token:transfer) {
 *         InlineTraces: [
 *           ActionTrace(from/eosio.token:transfer) {
 *             InlineTraces: [
 *               ActionTrace(contractX/contractX:log)
 *             ]
 *           }
 *           ActionTrace(to/eosio.token:transfer) {
 *             InlineTraces: [
 *               ActionTrace(contractY/contractY:update)
 *             ]
 *           }
 *         ]
 *       }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This will results in the following flattened actions list being returned:
 *
 * ```
 * [
 *   ActionTrace(eosio.token/eosio.token:transfer),
 *   ActionTrace(from/eosio.token:transfer),
 *   ActionTrace(contractX/contractX:log),
 *   ActionTrace(to/eosio.token:transfer),
 *   ActionTrace(contractY/contractY:update),
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * @param transaction The transaction lifecycle object to flatten action traces from.
 * @returns A flat list of action traces extracted from the transaction lifecycle for which each
 * index of the list represents the action's index concept of dfuse API.

/**
 * This method extracts the matchinf actions out of [[SearchTransactionRow]]
 * object.
 *
 * Using the search endpoint, you receives a [[SearchTransactionRow]] that
 * is simply a composite object containing an actual [[TransactionLifecycle]]
 * element as well as a list of action indexes which are the actual
 * ones that matched your query.
 *
 * A single transaction can contains a big amount of actions but usually,
 * only a subset of the actions in a transaction matches your search query.
 *
 * By using this method, you can easily extracts the matching actions
 * out of the [[SearchTransactionRow]] object.
 *
 * @param searchRow The search result row to extract matching action traces from.
 * @returns A flat list of action traces extracted from the search result row that matched
 * the query term(s).

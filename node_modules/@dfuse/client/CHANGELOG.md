# Changelog

## 0.3.10 (May 12, 2020)

- Added client instance id generated stream id.

## 0.3.9 (April 16, 2020)

- Added the ability to run the client without authentication. By passing the `authURL` option
  as `null://....` it will not retrieve a authentication token. Especially useful when running [dfuse for EOSIO](https://github.com/dfuse-io/dfuse-eosio)

## 0.3.8 (February 6, 2020)

- Enhance `Abi` exported types (subtypes were not exported before).

## 0.3.7 (February 3, 2020)

- Fix `StateKeyAccountsResponse` type `account_names` field name which was incorrectly
  named `accounts` before which was not in-sync with server definition.

## 0.3.6 (January 28, 2020)

- Do not try to reconnect when WebSocket error is 1009 (message too big).

## 0.3.5 (December 24, 2019)

- Exposed an internal method for internal (i.e. dfuse) consumption.

- Deprecated `OutboundMessage` message factory functions: `getHeadInfoMessage`,
  `getTableRowsMessage`, `getActionTracesMessage` and `getTransactionLifecycleMessage`.
  They will be removed in future releases.

## 0.3.4 (December 19, 2019)

- Fixed `stream.join()` implementation for GraphQL stream when impossible to re-connect.
- Improvements to debug output related to received Socket messages.
- Fixed bad validation of `apiKey` field, it's now handles `undefined` and `null` values.

## 0.3.3 (December 18, 2019)

- Fix a bug where a GraphQL stream could re-connect with an expired token, you are invited
  to update to this version.

## 0.3.2 (December 16, 2019)

- Added a `dfuse-trace:` debug namespace so by default, `dfuse:*` can be put on
  for debugging purposes without generating tons of messages.

## 0.3.1 (November 26, 2019)

- Fixed avoid polluting the global scope example now that we added a second stream client
  interface.

- Removed usage of `finally` call on Promise to get back support for Node.js < 10.x.

## 0.3.0 (October 1, 2019)

- Official 0.3.0 release.

- Fixed socket trying to re-connect when disconnection was asked directly by the client.

- The cursor is sent empty when not present in GraphQL stream. Still possible to pass
  your own.

## 0.3.0-rc.6 (September 30, 2019)

- Fixed some `@ts-ignore` that would cause library consumer to choke on compiling.

## 0.3.0-rc.5 (September 30, 2019)

- Moved `@types/debug` from `devDependencies` to a plain `dependencies` instead.

## 0.3.0-rc.4 (September 20, 2019)

- The second parameter of streaming `OnMessage` handler for both WebSocket
  and GraphQL is the full `Stream` object. Previously it was a different
  type named `marker` but this was not the clearest way. This is a backward
  compatible move, the old interface was a subset of the `Stream` interface.

  By doing this, it is also possible to close the stream straight within
  the message handler via `stream.close()` call.

## 0.3.0-rc.3 (September 18, 2019)

### Changes

- Added `terminal` property on `error` message received by the `OnGraphqlStreamMessage`
  so consumer can determine if this is a fatal error and the stream is
  now terminated or if it's a resolver error and more data will come in.

- Added `autoDisconnectSocket` option to add the possibility to prevent
  automatic disconnection of socket when no more stream are active in
  the client.

- Fixed `GraphqlStreamClient.unregisterStream` not correctly resolving the
  `stream.join()` Promise.

- A `1005` WebSocket close code is now considered to be an abnormal closure
  and will trigger a re-connection. `1005` is a close message without
  any reason. The spec is unclear if normal closing of the connection
  can use both `1000` and `1005`. However, since we control the backend, we
  will now assume that a `1005` is an abnormal condition and dfuse WebSocket
  handling will always send a correct `1000` code for a normal ending of the
  socket connection.

- A GraphQL stream will now auto restart when an error message has been
  received from the backend.

## 0.3.0-rc.2 (September 10, 2019)

### Changes

- Improved TypeScript typings on `graphql` to ensure automatic inference
  can be done when using `query/mutation` via HTTP over any operation
  in streaming mode.

- The streaming `onMessage` handler for `graphql` now receives a second
  argument `marker` than can has a method `mark` to easily mark the
  stream at cursor location within the message handler directly.

- The streaming `onMessage` handler for `streamXXX` calls now receives a second
  argument `marker` than can has a method `mark` to easily mark the
  stream at cursor location within the message handler directly.

### Breaking Changes (Between `rc.1` and `rc.2`)

- The `graphql()` method types has changed so TypeScript can automatically
  infers the actual return type. There is now two signatures possible for
  `graphql`.

  The request/response version:

  ```
  graphql<T = any>(
    document: string | GraphqlDocument,
    options?: {
      variables?: GraphqlVariables
      operationType?: Exclude<GraphqlOperationType, "subscription">
    }
  ): Promise<GraphqlResponse<T>>
  ```

  This version is used for `Query` or `Mutation` going only and by using
  this signature, you are telling us to use the HTTP transport layer. This
  signature always returns a `Promise<GraphqlResponse<T>>` and doesn't
  accept any listener.

  The streaming version:

  ```
  graphql<T = any>(
    document: string | GraphqlDocument,
    onMessage: OnGraphqlStreamMessage<T>,
    options?: {
      variables?: GraphqlVariables
      operationType?: GraphqlOperationType
    }
  ): Promise<Stream>
  ```

  This version can be used with all operation types and by using
  this signature, you are telling us to use the WebSocket transport layer.
  This always returns a `Promise<Stream>` and is now similar to other streaming
  method in the client.

  To upgrade, change all you streaming calls from:

  ```
  graphql(` <document> `, { onMessage: (...) => { <handler> }, variables: { ... } })
  ```

  To

  ```
  graphql(` <document> `, (...) => { <handler> }, { variables: { ... } })
  ```

  The `query` or `mutation` calls remains the same, but you might need to fix
  typings of those since we now return a `GraphqlResponse<T>` instance of a plain
  `T` type.

  You can then remove any `as Promise<...>` typecast you might had before to help
  TypeScript infer the right type.

## 0.3.0-rc.1 (August 31, 2019)

### Changes

- Added support for GraphQL directly in the library. The client has now a `graphql(...)` method.
  All document operation type are supported: Query, Mutation & Subscription. For now, you must provide
  the document as a `string` value. You can use the `gql` string literal, but you must send it as a
  string to the client for now. See [GraphQL - Use 'gql' tag & Typings](./examples/advanced/graphql-gql-tag.ts)
  example about how to do just that.

  **Note** Passing directly a `gql` will be supported on the next iteration of the release candidate.

- It's now possible to `join` an existing `Stream` object. After receiving a stream, you can
  now do `await stream.join()` to wait until the `Stream` completes. A stream completes when:

  - It's `close` method has been called by the client.
  - The server sent the completion message completing the stream.
  - The server sent an irrecoverable error terminating the stream.

- Added support for `GET /v0/state/table/row` (`stateTableRow`) endpoint.

- Added support for `symbol` and `symbol_code` as valid `key_type` for easier conversion of values.

- Now using `POST` version for `stateTablesForScopes` and `stateTableForAccounts`.

### Breaking Changes

- (Light) The `SocketOptions#onInvalidMessage` has been removed completely. Since now all messages are
  forwarded, this was now useless. Note that `ping` and other `keep alive` are still trapped by the library
  and you will never receive them directly anymore.

- (Light) The `SocketListenerMessage` type now being more loose, all messages are forwarded to it, so it could be
  possible to receive messages that you did not receive before. This trickles down to the `OnStreamMessage` listener
  of Stream API. Ensures that you validate the `type` field and only consume messages that are of interest to you.

  But in reality, this has really low impact as the protocol did not change and as such, no new messages can arrive
  for now.

- (Light) The `SocketListenerMessage` type is has been loosen, now accepting `unknown` instead of `InboundMessage`.
- (Light) The `Socket#send` method type has been loosen, now accepting `unknown` instead of `OutboundMessage`.

### Deprecations

- Deprecated `ConnectOptions` (renamed to `SocketConnectOptions` in a different file now also).

## 0.2.10 (August 12, 2019)

- Fixed typings for `stateTableForScopes` and `stateTableForAccounts` that was not correct
  according to dfuse REST API.

## 0.2.9 (August 12, 2019)

- Fixed typings for `StateTableScopesResponse` that was not correct
  according to dfuse REST API.

## 0.2.8 (July 26, 2019)

- Bumped development dependencies.
- Typo in example file (thanks @marcuswin).

## 0.2.7 (July 26, 2019)

- Added support for `Worbli` network straight in the library.

## 0.2.6 (May 24, 2019)

- Improves WebSocket streaming reference examples to better
  show the message flow.

- Fixed basic streaming examples that were not behaving as
  expected due to a bug.

- Added a `release` method on all interfaces used by the
  `DfuseClient` so a release of some hold handles can be
  performed.

- Added `endpoints` getter on `DfuseClient` to reduce code
  required when using Apollo Link.

## 0.2.5 (May 2, 2019)

- Added a check to ensure the API key provided to `createDfuseClient`
  is actually a valid API key. A specialized message being displayed to
  those using an API token instead.

## 0.2.4 (April 30, 2019)

- Renamed `ActionTraceData` `DbOp` to `ActionTraceDbOp`. This fixes
  a problem where `DbOp` type from library was always the `TableDeltaData`
  one since they were conflicting having the same name. This rename is **not**
  a breaking change since it was impossible to import the type.

- Fix `ActionTraceData` `dbops` field definition which was incorrectly
  using `TableDeltaData` `DbOp` definition while not being the same at all.

  **Warning** Requires some modification steps (resolving new compilation
  errors for some usage of the library's types). See
  [From '@dfuse/client@0.2.3' to '@dfuse/client@0.2.4'](./MIGRATION.md#from-dfuseclient023-to-dfuseclient024)
  section in migration guide.

- Removed duplicated `DbOp` definition which was wrong anyway.

### Deprecations

- Deprecated `RAMOP` (renamed to `RamOp`).
- Deprecated `DBOp` (renamed to `DbOp`).

## 0.2.3 (April 30, 2019)

- Fixed typing mismatch between dfuse WebSocket API JSON output
  and our own type definitions.

  **Warning** Requires some modification steps (resolving new compilation
  errors for some usage of the library's types). See
  [From '@dfuse/client@0.2.2' to '@dfuse/client@0.2.3'](./MIGRATION.md#from-dfuseclient022-to-dfuseclient023)
  section in migration guide.

## 0.2.2 (April 26, 2019)

- Added support for `GET /v0/block_id/by_time` endpoint.

- Added possibility to get a valid API token straight from the dfuse Client
  instance. This enables consumer of our GraphQL API to delegate API key
  management logic to `@dfuse/client` library.

## 0.2.1 (April 24, 2019)

- Fixed dfuse Search API `blockCount` default value that was larger
  than a Uint32 value being the biggest value accepted by dfuse API.

- Added support for `GET /v0/transactions/:id` endpoint.

- Added `matchingActionTraces` helper to easily extract a
  the matching action traces out of a `SearchTransactionRow` when performing
  a search query through dfuse REST API search endpoint.

- Added `flattenActionTraces` helper to easily extract action traces
  from a `TransactionLifecycle` object (useful to find matching action
  for action index used by dfuse API).

- Fixed a bunch of typing errors between actual `nodeos` JSON output
  and our own type definitions as well against dfuse API directly.
  **Warning** Requires some modification steps (resolving new compilation
  errors for some usage of the library's types). See [From '@dfuse/client@0.2.0' to '@dfuse/client@0.2.1'](./MIGRATION.md#from-dfuseclient020-to-dfuseclient021) section in migration guide.

## 0.2.0 (April 23, 2019)

- Removed `socket` public property from `StreamClient` interface to
  reduce coupling.

- It's now possible to add custom headers when using
  `DfuseClient.apiRequest` method (same on underlying `HttpClient`
  interface).

- Now exposing `dfuseClient.apiRequest` as a public method of the
  `DfuseClient` interface.

- Fixed UMD build that was not minified anymore due to an oversight.

- Fixed UMD build that incorrectly had `require(...)` clauses and
  that could be picked for transformation by some bundler tool.

- The function `isExpiredOrNearExpiration` has been renamed to
  `isApiTokenExpired` to better reflect the intention of the method.

- Changed default reconnect delay value from `5s` to `2.5s`.

- Added a `Stream.onPostRestart` callback that can be used to act after a
  successful stream restart, see [./examples/advanced/never-miss-a-beat.ts]
  for usage.

- Fixed a bug where re-connect was not connected back if an error
  occurred in the reconnect itself.

- Added a `OnDiskApiTokenStore` to store the token under
  `~/.dfuse/<sha256-api-key>/token.json` file using the `FileApiTokenStore`
  and make it the default in a Node.js environment.

- Added a `FileApiTokenStore` to store the token info under a given file
  (can be used only in a Node.js environment).

- Added `LocalStorageApiTokenStore` implementation and make it the default
  in a Browser environment.

- Now distributing an `es5` and `umd` build in addition to the old previous
  `commonjs` build (now under `dist/lib`).

- Added `dynamicMessageDispatcher` helper to easily create an `OnStreamMessage`
  that dispatches to correct handler based on the message's type.

- Streams now auto-restart at last marked block if present or at provided
  value upon socket re-connection.

- Add full support for marking the stream at the right location.

- Renamed the library to `@dfuse/client`.

- Major overhaul of the full API of the library to become a full dfuse Client library,
  read the `MIGRATION.md` guide for more details on how to go from `@dfuse/eosws-js` to
  the full blown `@dfuse/client`.

### From 0.2.0-rc.2 to 0.2.0-rc.3

- The `unlisten` function of a `Stream` (has returned by `registerStream`), has
  been renamed to `close`. Simply rename the method to upgrade.

- Renamed `getTransactionMessage` to `getTransactionLifecycleMessage`.
- Renamed `OutboundMessageType.TRANSACTION` to `OutboundMessageType.TRANSACTION_LIFECYCLE`.

## 0.10.0 (November 9, 2018)

### Breaking Changes

- Removed all previous code, everything has been replaced by a proper `EoswsClient` object.

#### Package

The previous package was mostly released on name `eosws`. The package has been migrated to
our `dfuse` branding instead, so first, you will need to update that.

    yarn remove eosws
    yarn add @dfuse/eosws-js

or using NPM:

    npm uninstall --save @dfuse/eosws-js
    npm install --save @dfuse/eosws-js

#### Listening

Instead of:

    import { get_actions, parse_actions } from 'eoswjs'

    const endpoint = 'mainnet.eos.dfuse.io'
    const origin = 'https://example.com'
    const token = '<Paste your API token here>'

    const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://${endpoint}/v1/stream?token=${token}`, { origin })

    ws.onopen = () => {
      ws.send(get_actions({ accounts: 'eosio.token', action_names: 'transfer' }))
    }

    ws.onmessage = (message) => {
      const actions = parse_actions(message.data)

      if (actions) {
        const { from, to, quantity, memo } = actions.data.trace.act.data
        console.log(from, to, quantity, memo)
      }
    }

You should replace with:

    import { EoswsClient, createEoswsSocket, InboundMessageType } from '@dfuse/eosws-js'

    const endpoint = 'mainnet.eos.dfuse.io'
    const token = '<Paste your API token here>'
    const client = new EoswsClient(createEoswsSocket(() =>
        new WebSocket(`wss://${endpoint}/v1/stream?token=${token}`, { origin: 'https://example.com' })))

    client.connect().then(() => {
        client
            .getActionTraces({ accounts: 'eosio.token', action_names: 'transfer' })
            .onMessage((message) => {
                if (message.type === InboundMessageType.ACTION_TRACE) {
                    const { from, to, quantity, memo } = message.data.trace.act.data
                    console.log(from, to, quantity, memo)
                }
            })
    })

#### Parsing Messages

This functionality has been removed completely, you will need to make the checking by "hand":

    onMessage = (message) => {
        if (message.type === 'action_trace') {
            console.log('Action trace, do something useful.')
        }
    }

#### Creating Messages

If you only want to create messages, the functionality is still available. Instead of doing:

    import { get_actions } from 'eoswjs'

    // ... WebSocket stuff here

    ws.send(get_actions({ accounts: 'eosio.token', action_names: 'transfer' }))

Do this instead:

    import { getActionTracesMessage } from '@dfuse/eosws-js'

    ws.send(getActionTracesMessage({ accounts: 'eosio.token', action_names: 'transfer' }))

Here the list of available message constructors:

- `getActionTracesMessage`
- `getTableRowsMessage`
- `getTransactionLifecycleMessage`

**Note** Those constructors are not documented yet as part of the API and might be removed
in the future, this has not been decided yet. Refer to the [src/message/outbound.ts](./src/message/outbound.ts)
file for available parameters for each constructors.

### Improvements

- Added a proper `EoswsSocket` that automatically re-connects on abnormal closing.
- Added a proper `EoswsClient` to wrap all operations correctly.
- Overhaul of examples and supporting documentation.

## 0.9.2 (October 31, 2018)

- On `get_actions` & `get_table_deltas` only has two params (data parameters & optional parameters) both as defined as Objects.
- On `get_actions`, `receiver` is now optional and defaults to the same value as `account`.
- The `get_table_deltas` request was renamed to `get_table_rows`.
